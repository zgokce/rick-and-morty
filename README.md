This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the home page.

You can list all locations by clicking the location button on the home page or by opening the link [http://localhost:3000/locations](http://localhost:3000/locations).


By clicking one of the locations on the Locations page, you can see or filter all dead, alive or unknown (status indicator) characters for that location.

Clicking on one of the character boxes will take you to the character details page. On the character details page, you can see the status and location of the character you selected and other characters with the same characteristics.
